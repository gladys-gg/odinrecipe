    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the garlic pork chops: Combine paprika, garlic powder, 
            salt and pepper in a small bowl. 
            Pat the pork chops dry with kitchen paper then season 
            generously with the spice mix. Heat olive oil and butter in 
            a skillet over medium-high until butter is melted.

        </li>
        <li>
            Sear the pork chops for 3-5 minutes per side until well browned on both sides. 
            Transfer the pork chops to a warm plate and set aside. 
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same skillet, add the mushrooms and stir fry until golden brown, 
            scraping up any bits leftover from the chops.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add garlic, parsley and Italian seasoning then stir fry for 
            another 30 seconds before pouring in the broth. Add the cream, 
            give a good stir then allow simmering for 3-4 minutes until 
            slightly thickened and adjust seasoning if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place pork chops and their juices back into the sauce and 
            allow to simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the pork chops 
            are cooked to your liking. Garnish with remaining fresh 
            parsley and serve the garlic pork chops in creamy mushroom 
            sauce immediately with cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, or pasta. Enjoy!
